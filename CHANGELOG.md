## 0.2.1

- Depends on `morphnext: ^0.7.1` instead of pinning `0.6.1`, so apps can use
  morphtext alongside current morphnext. MorphText now reads glyphs and plans
  morphs through morphnext's public glyph API (`MorphFont`, `MorphOutline`,
  `MorphOutlinePlan`), which shipped in 0.7.0. Thanks to KickNext, who
  shipped the API and ported morphtext onto it
  ([#1](https://github.com/drei-gg/morphtext/pull/1)). Morphs look the same;
  in a few letter pairs, points in mid-flight frames pair slightly
  differently.

## 0.2.0

- The system font morphs on iOS, with nothing bundled. SF Pro can't ship in
  an app (TN3214), so it was never in `FontManifest.json` and morphed as
  plain text switching at the middle. A style that names no family, or
  `CupertinoSystemText` or `CupertinoSystemDisplay`, now reads the font iOS
  draws it with: CoreText's tables, through `dart:ffi` (public API), read
  once in memory. Each weight is read where Flutter draws it on SF's axes,
  measured on an iPhone (iOS 26) against `Text`: 95-98% of the same pixels
  at 64 px. Other platforms are unchanged.
- Variable fonts morph at the `wght` and `opsz` each style's
  `fontVariations` asks for, instead of always at the font's default
  instance.
- Three examples for the system font, run on an iPhone:
  `example/lib/system_font_main.dart` (morphs, and a check of the outlines
  against `Text`), and two reels that render themselves frame by frame on
  the phone, `system_font_reel.dart` and `system_font_flyer.dart`.

- A second example, Records (`example/lib/records.dart`): MorphText in a Hero
  flight, a title morphing from the list's style to the page's as it flies.
  The README's *In a Hero* covers the two things that make it look right: a
  transparent `Material` around the shuttle, and a straight `RectTween` for
  square artwork.

## 0.1.2

- A word and an icon now morph as one shape, every letter from its place in
  the word, instead of each letter carrying its own copy of the icon. The
  copies drifted apart as the morph began and covered each other's holes,
  so an outline icon (Tabler, Lucide, Material's `_border` and `_outline`
  icons) turned solid before it started to change. Letters with nothing to
  become now shrink away rather than all flowing into the icon.

## 0.1.1

- A shorter package description, within pub.dev's 180 characters.
- Changelog tidy-up.

## 0.1.0

First release.

- `MorphText`: text morphing letter by letter, driven by `progress` (an
  `Animation<double>`, as morphnext's `MorphIcon` takes it), between any two
  styles (weight, size, colour, slant, or one font family into another) and,
  with `toText`, from one word into another. Plain text at either end.
- `AnimatedMorphText`: springs to each new text and style with morphnext's
  `MorphSprings.snappy` by default (re-exported; any `SpringDescription`
  works), reversing mid-flight from where it is and keeping its velocity;
  or along an optional `curve` over a fixed `duration`. Plain text at rest,
  faded in over the outlines in the last of the motion (`handoff`, 0.1 by
  default) so nothing changes after it lands. `MorphText` and `MorphBetween` take `handoff` too, 0 by default.
- `MorphContent`, `MorphBetween` and `AnimatedMorph`: text and icons morph
  into each other (a word flows into an icon, an icon into another), read
  from any bundled icon font; each end is pixel for pixel a `Text` or `Icon`.
- Letters pair by a weighted edit distance; leftover letters shrink to or
  grow from a point.
- Extracted from an app we're building, where it carries a name from a light
  title to a card's bold one.
